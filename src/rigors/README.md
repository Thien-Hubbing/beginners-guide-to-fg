# Introduction

Now, let us take a different path. _What if we approached Fictional Googology in a rigorous manner?_ Sure, the idea is still having fun making numbers, but now the fun is not primarily found in symbols or visuals, but rather the intricacies of the concepts and ideas operating behind the scenes... and in seeing how much the springs of logic can be stretched until they break...

## What is this branch?
This is **Rigorous FG** (aka. rFG), a different and unique branch of the Fictional Googology community that is still just as much as an artform as the [informal side](../informals/index.md). However, instead of writing up fancy functions and entries, you write up complex definitions with intricate details and arguments.

Basically, if FG was an actual field of study, this would be the closest thing to it.
