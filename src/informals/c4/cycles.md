# Higher Cyclings

There are even higher cycle levels, and many other cycle types that are used throughout the Fictional Googology community. This here provides a list of some of the most commonly used ones.

- **Minicycles:** The first ever cycle type made, in Mathis R.V’s Numbers 0 to NEVER [1 / 2]. They are extremely basic, has very few frames and don’t do much.
- **"Cycle/Layer/Phase" Cycle:** One of the types of cycles made by Mathis R.V, they are fixed with a Cycle, Layer, and Phase frame with the only changes being the number is used.
- **DuplicationCcycle**: Involves a bunch of progressively faster scrolling entries grouped up into 1 entry, indicating the amount of entries being duplicated.
