# Cycles
Within the Questionaire Regions (???? [x] paths), we begin to introduce the concept of a **Cycle**. These first appeared in Mathis R.V's Numbers 0 to NEVER [1/2], but became way more common after the advent of **Numbers 0 to ???? [2]** and **???? [3]**.

As defined by the Common FG Specification, a cycle is a repeated application of a set of functions over and over again on a base entry. They are always used for reaching massive milestones.

Cycles are typically displayed in a video format, and has attributes are applied to the previous cycle frame (referred to as [P]). These attributes are often displayed as a word suffixed with -ize, surrounding the previous frame.

There are many kinds of cycles, one of the crazier kind we'll see later. But let's show what a supercycle is.
