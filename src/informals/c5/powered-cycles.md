# Powered Cycles
**Powered Cycles** are cycles that are intended to be more chaotic and "powerful" by applying certain aspects such as [Absolutely Everything Versions](./ae-versions.md) and audiovisual effects. There are higher "powered" levels such as superpowered cycles, megapowered cycles, and so on and so forth.

These are very similar to supercycles as we'll introduce later, having many of the same patterns and effects used with only a few notable differences.

Some of the [A.E. Version](./ae-versions/index.md) that are used are:
- [Layers](./ae-versions/layers.md) - Reusing a clip / export and copy it into portions.
- [Speedramps](./ae-versions/speedramps.md) - Gradually speeding up the clip till it gets exhausted.
- [Black Hole](./ae-versions/black-holes.md): Introduced in Mathis's Part X, a black hole spawns at the center and grows bigger until it fills up the screen. Found within the explosions part.
