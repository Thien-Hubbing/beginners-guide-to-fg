# General Rules
There's some common communal rules/expectations that you should follow while participating in this field.

## 1: Numbers never end.
**Fictional Googology** is designed to be endless and infinite, so trying to end the entire number line by making an "End-All-Be-All" will absolutely cause problems and controversies.

This does **not** mean however you cannot end your **own** number line, as that is separate from the main path. Basically:
- You **cannot** end other's number line or the field entirely.
- You **can** end your own number paths and series.
